A/Gb mode only:Indicates this clause applies only to a GSM system which operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
Iu mode only:Indicates this clause applies only to UMTS system. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
Acceptable Cell:This is a cell that the MS may camp on to make emergency calls. It must satisfy criteria which are defined for A/Gb mode in 3GPP TS 43.022 [35], for Iu mode in 3GPP TS 25.304 [32], and for S1 mode in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43].
Access Technology:The access technology associated with a PLMN. The MS uses this information to determine what type of radio carrier to search for when attempting to select a specific PLMN (e.g., GSM, UTRAN, GSM COMPACT or E-UTRAN). A PLMN may support more than one access technology.
Allowable PLMN:In the case of a MS operating in MS operation mode A or B, this is a PLMN which is not in the list of forbidden PLMNs in the MS. In the case of a MS operating in MS operation mode C, this is a PLMN which is not in the list of forbidden PLMNs or in the list of forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service in the MS
Location Registration LR:An MS which is IMSI attached to non-GPRS services only performs location registration by the Location Updating procedure. A GPRS MS which is IMSI attached to GPRS services or to GPRS and non-GPRS services performs location registration by the Routing Area Update procedure only when in a network of network operation mode I. Both location updating and routing area update procedures are performed independently by the GPRS MS when it is IMSI attached to GPRS and non-GPRS services in a network of network operation mode II (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [27]). An MS which is attached via the E-UTRAN performs location registration by the tracking area update procedure.
Available PLMN/access technology combination:This is an available PLMN in a specific access technology.
Camped on a cell:The MS (ME if there is no SIM) has completed the cell selection/reselection process and has chosen a cell from which it plans to receive all available services. Note that the services may be limited, and that the PLMN may not be aware of the existence of the MS (ME) within the chosen cell.
Country:A country is identified by a single MCC value, with the exception that MCC values 310 through 316 identify a single country (USA) and MCC values 404 through 406 identify a single country (India).
EAB:Extended Access Barring,see 3GPP TS 22.011 [9].
Current serving cell:This is the cell on which the MS is camped.
CTS MS:An MS capable of CTS services is a CTS MS.
Available PLMN:For GERAN A/Gb mode see 3GPP TS 43.022 [35]. For UTRAN see 3GPP TS 25.304 [32]. For E-UTRAN see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. For cdma2000? 1xRTT and cdma2000? HRPD see 3GPP2 C.S0016 [44].
EHPLMN:Any of the PLMN entries contained in the Equivalent HPLMN list.
Equivalent HPLMN list:To allow provision for multiple HPLMN codes, PLMN codes that are present within this list shall replace the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI for PLMN selection purposes. This list is stored on the USIM and is known as the EHPLMN list. The EHPLMN list may also contain the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI. If the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI is not present in the EHPLMN list then it shall be treated as a Visited PLMN for PLMN selection purposes.
GPRS MS:An MS capable of GPRS services is a GPRS MS. 
High quality signal:The high quality signal limit is used in the PLMN selection procedure. It is defined in the appropriate AS specification
Home PLMN:This is a PLMN where the MCC and MNC of the PLMN identity match the MCC and MNC of the IMSI. Matching criteria are defined in Annex A.
In A/Gb mode:Indicates this clause applies only to a GSM system which operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
In Iu mode:Indicates this clause applies only to UMTS system. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
Localised Service Area LSA:A localised service area consists of a cell or a number of cells. The cells constituting a LSA may not necessarily provide contiguous coverage. 
MS:Mobile Station. The present document makes no distinction between MS and UE.
SIM:Subscriber Identity Module (see 3GPP TS 21.111 [38]). The present document makes no distinction between SIM and USIM.
Registered PLMN RPLMN:This is the PLMN on which certain LR outcomes have occurred (see table 1). In a shared network the RPLMN is the PLMN defined by the PLMN identity of the CN operator that has accepted the LR.
Registration:This is the process of camping on a cell of the PLMN and doing any necessary LRs.
Registration Area:A registration area is an area in which mobile stations may roam without a need to perform location registration. The registration area corresponds to location area (LA) for performing location updating procedure, to routing area for performing the GPRS attach or routing area update procedures,and to list of tracking areas (TAs) for performing the EPS attach or tracking area update procedure.The PLMN to which a cell belongs (PLMN identity) is given in the system information transmitted on the BCCH (MCC + MNC part of LAI). In a shared network a cell belongs to all PLMNs given in the system information transmitted on the BCCH.
Selected PLMN:This is the PLMN that has been selected according to subclause 3.1, either manually or automatically.
Shared Network:An MS considers a cell to be part of a shared network, when multiple PLMN identities are received on the BCCH.  
Network Type:The network type associated with HPLMN or a PLMN on the PLMN selector (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]). The MS uses this information to determine what type of radio carrier to search for when attempting to select a specific PLMN. A PLMN may support more than one network type. 
SoLSA exclusive access:Cells on which normal camping is allowed only for MS with Localised Service Area (LSA) subscription.
Suitable Cell:This is a cell on which an MS may camp. It must satisfy criteria which are defined for GERAN A/Gb mode in 3GPP TS 43.022 [35], for UTRAN in 3GPP TS 25.304 [32] and for E-UTRAN in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. For 3GPP2 access technologies the criteria are defined in 3GPP2 C.S0011 [45] for cdma2000? 1xRTT and in 3GPP2 C.S0033 [46] for cdma2000? HRPD.
Steering of Roaming:A technique whereby a roaming UE is encouraged to roam to a preferred roamed-to network by the HPLMN.
Visited PLMN:This is a PLMN different from the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or different from an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present).
Application Layer connection-less group:An application layer group without group formation in the V2X application layer, e.g., sensor sharing.
Application Layer ID:An identifier identifying an entity, e.g. a vehicle, a pedestrian, an RSU within the context of a specific V2X application. The format of this identifier is outside the scope of 3GPP.
Application Layer managed group:An application layer group with group formation and management in the V2X application layer, e.g., platooning, cooperative adaptive cruise control.
Groupcast mode communication:It refers to V2X communication over PC5 reference point within a group of UEs where any UE in the group can act as transmitting UE and the rest act as receiving UEs. See also TS 38.300 [11] for more information. The group here refers to Application Layer managed group or Application Layer connection-less group.
Member ID:An identifier uniquely identifying a member in the Application Layer managed group and that is managed by the V2X application layer.
Mode of communication:Mode of communication to be used by the UE over PC5 reference point i.e. broadcast mode (LTE PC5 and NR PC5), groupcast mode (NR PC5) or unicast mode (NR PC5).
V2X application:An application using one or more V2X services e.g. an active safety application in a vehicle, using V2X services such as emergency warning and vehicle to vehicle safety and awareness. A V2X application may operate towards a V2X Application Server.
V2X communication:A communication to support Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services leveraging Uu and / or PC5 reference points. V2X services are realized by various types of V2X applications, i.e. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N).
V2X message:A dedicated messaging type of V2X service, for example ITS messages.
V2X service:A data service, offered to V2X applications and optionally V2X Application Servers. A V2X service belongs to one V2X service type. It may include message or other data delivery, as defined in TS 22.185 [2] and TS 22.186 [3]. A V2X service can be associated with one or more V2X applications, and a V2X application can be associated with one or more V2X services.
V2X service type:A type of V2X service, which is identified by e.g. ITS-AID (ITS Application Identifier), PSID (Provider Service Identifier) or AID (Application Identifier).
RR connection:a RR connection is a dedicated physical circuit switched domain connection used by the two RR or RRC peer entities to support the upper layers' exchange of information flows.
PS signalling connection: a peer to peer UMTS connection between MS and CN packet domain node.
GPRS:Packet Services for GSM and UMTS system.
A/Gb mode only:indicates this section or paragraph applies only to GSM system. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
Iu mode only:indicates this section or paragraph applies only to UMTS system. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
S1 mode only:indicates this section or paragraph applies only to Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and E-UTRAN access. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
In A/Gb mode:Indicates this paragraph applies only to GSM System. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
In Iu mode:Indicates this paragraph applies only to UMTS System. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
In S1 mode:Indicates this paragraph applies only to Evolved Packet Core and E-UTRAN access. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
SIM:Subscriber Identity Module (see 3GPP TS 42.017 [5c]). This specification makes no distinction between SIM and USIM.
MS:Mobile Station. This specification makes no distinction between MS and UE.
GSM security context:A GSM security context is established and stored in the MS and the network as a result of a successful execution of a GSM authentication challenge. The GSM security context for the CS domain consists of the GSM ciphering key and the ciphering key sequence number. The GSM security context for the PS domain consists of the GPRS GSM ciphering key and the GPRS ciphering key sequence number.
UMTS security context:A UMTS security context is established and stored in the MS and the network as a result of a successful execution of a UMTS authentication challenge. The UMTS security context for the CS domain consists of the UMTS ciphering key, the UMTS integrity key, the GSM ciphering key, the ciphering key sequence number and the GSM Kc128 (if an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is in use). The UMTS security context for the PS domain consists of the GPRS UMTS ciphering key, the GPRS UMTS integrity key, the GPRS GSM ciphering key, the GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the GPRS GSM Kc128 (if a GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is in use).
attached for emergency bearer services:An MS is attached for emergency bearer services if it has successfully completed an attach for emergency bearer services or if it has only a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established.
idle mode:In this mode,the mobile station is not allocated any dedicated channel; it listens to the CCCH and the BCCH;
group receive mode:(only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening) In this mode, the mobile station is not allocated a dedicated channel with the network; it listens to the downlink of a voice broadcast channel or voice group call channel allocated to the cell. Occasionally, the mobile station has to listen to the BCCH of the serving cell as defined in 3GPP TS 43.022 [82] and 3GPP TS 45.008 [34];
dedicated mode:In this mode,the mobile station is allocated at least two dedicated channels, only one of them being a SACCH;
