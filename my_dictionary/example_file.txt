Secondary Cell Group:For a UE configured with DC, the subset of serving cells not part of the MCG, i.e. comprising of the PSCell and zero or more other secondary cells.
Secondary Timing Advance Group:Timing Advance Group neither containing the PCell nor the PSCell. A secondary timing advance group contains at least one cell with configured uplink.
Serving Cell:For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED not configured with CA/ DC there is only one serving cell comprising of the primary cell. For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED configured with CA/ DC the term 'serving cells' is used to denote the set of one or more cells comprising of the primary cell and all secondary cells.

Sidelink communication:AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct Communication as defined in TS 23.303 [68], between two or more nearby UEs, using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node. In this version, the terminology "sidelink communication" without "V2X" prefix only concerns PS unless specifically stated otherwise.
